# EBI_DLemulator
Deep Residual Regression Neural Network from the paper “Emulation of an atmospheric gas-phase chemistry solver through deep learning” in Keras is built for replacing and accelerating the gas-phase chemistry solution procedure in the chemical transport models  
 
## Data
A state-of-the-art open-source CTM version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model (https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/5.2) is selected to derive the training and validation data for the emulator of the gas chemistry solver
